## ⚙️ Working Flow  

🧠 Here's how the calculator works:  

1. All buttons (numbers, operators, clear, equal) are selected dynamically.  
2. When a user clicks a button:  
   - Its value is added to the expression string.  
   - Display updates in real time.  
3. When `=` is pressed, `eval()` executes the math operation.  
4. Pressing `C` clears everything.  

💡 *Note:* `eval()` is used for simplicity in this mini project.  
For production-level apps, a safer math parsing method is recommended.
